AWS CLOUD RESUME CHALLENGE

This is my resume that i created through the Cloud Resume Challenge: https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/. 

The proejct is a multi-step project making a full stack website where i build and demonstrated my knowledge / skills 
using a variety of the AWS features to accomplish a full runnning website. 

The tech stack that I personally used is S3, AWS cloud front, Certificate Manager, Route 53, AWS lambda, Dynamo DB, and github actions for CI/CD.
To create the counter for the website I personally used python on AWS lambda and pulled it fron Dynamo DB through an API. 
Used AWS IAM to get the secret access keyy, and bucket for repo for github
